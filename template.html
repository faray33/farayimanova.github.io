    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Story of a Sphere </h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates an understaing and implementation of multiple aspect taught during the bootcamp. The project represents a 3D figure - a sphere, that is in rotation about its axis. With every rotation, the sphere changes color and increases in size. When the sphere inevitably reaches a climax radius it bursts into confetti-like colorful particles that were making up the sphere itself

      <h3>2D Java Space Escapade </h3>
    <p>
	This Java project demonstrates an understaing and implementation of multiple aspect taught during my year at City. The game is a space shooter called Space Escapade. It is a bout a spaceship on a mission to reach an aircaft that is running out of supplies and provide it with necessary reinforcements, but it is faced with multiple obstacles and opponents.
